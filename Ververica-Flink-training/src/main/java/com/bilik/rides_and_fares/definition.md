The goal of this exercise is to join together the `TaxiRide` and `TaxiFare` records for each ride.

For each distinct `rideId`, there are exactly three events:

1. a `TaxiRide` START event
1. a `TaxiRide` END event
1. a `TaxiFare` event (whose timestamp happens to match the start time)

The result should be a `DataStream<RideAndFare>`, with one record for each distinct `rideId`. Each tuple should pair the `TaxiRide` START event for some `rideId` with its matching `TaxiFare`.

### Input Data

For this exercise you will work with two data streams, one with `TaxiRide` events generated by a `TaxiRideSource` and the other with `TaxiFare` events generated by a `TaxiFareSource`.

### Expected Output

The result of this exercise is a data stream of `RideAndFare` records, one for each distinct `rideId`. The exercise is setup to ignore the END events, and you should join the event for the START of each ride with its corresponding fare event.

Once you have both the ride and fare that belong together, you can create the desired object for the output stream by using

`new RideAndFare(ride, fare)`

The stream will be printed to standard out.
